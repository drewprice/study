Introduction
	There are many ideas thrown around in competing education circles on how to best motivate students, especially in the realm of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) of which computer science and ultimately software development are subcategories. There is particular concern regarding those that are underrepresented within STEM education: women and minorities. One side argues that the missing demographics may simply be due to a lack of personal interest by the underrepresented and, therefore, motivation need only focus on making appeals to draw these students into STEM fields. The other side blames shortcomings in the system of education that leave the underrepresented unprepared and unwilling to enter a STEM field, arguing that in order to motivate these students significant changes must be made in the environment of education. Further consideration of this debate reveals two competing ideologies regarding where the responsibility of a demographic shift really lies.

		Intro
			Many educators and academics believe this problem of underrepresentation may simply be due to a lack of interest in STEM fields from women and minority groups. While at first this may seem too simple, there is a good amount of data that supports this conclusion. Researchers have looked into this suspicion with surprising results and have, therefore, concluded that the work of balancing demographics within STEM fields should primarily be focused on creating an atmosphere which draws in more women and people from minority groups. More potently, the idea is that it is individuals' personal choice not to enter a STEM field. This view dismisses the proposed problem of systematic educational shortcomings, citing women's performance elsewhere in education, b, and the potential problems created by affirmative action.

			A. More career options
				One such concept looks beyond STEM education, and finds a simple explanation for the gender gap: perhaps women just have more options. A recent study by [], reveals this in an interesting way. Operating on the assumption that greater math skills make a person more likely to enter a STEM field, researchers compiled a group of nearly 1,500 12th grade students and, using SAT scores, evaluated their mathematical and werbal abilities. Years later when the students were turning 33 years old and had had time to settle into a career, the researchers surveyed them again to see what sort of fields the students had entered. As expected, students with a higher proficiency in mathematics were more likely to have chosen a STEM careerâ€”but only the students that scored well in mathematics alone, with their languages skills being lesser. Students that had been indentified as highly proficient in math and language, however, were less likely to enter a STEM field. The important discovery was this: women were more likely to fall into this category being highly proficient in both mathematics and language, and indeed held the majority with females comprising 63 percent of the group. This, Wang et all believes, "may result in females having a wider choice of careers, in both science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM fields, compared with males" [CITE]. In other words, the gender gap does not exist because women are less capable, but perhaps for the very opposite reason. The study reveals that women actually tend to have a greater variety of employable skill and may therefore choose to put those skills to work wherever they please; which, happends to be outside the realm of STEM.
			B. Why don't they like STEM?
				<-- Perhaps the reason math+language people did not enter STEM is that they were women, and there are other factors that prevent women from entering STEM. Not quite as simple as, "well, they just wanted to do something else." Just because they were capable does not mean they are/their community is necessarily willing. -->

	Synthesis: X argues personal, Y argues communal responsibility
		The debate over how to motivate underrepresented students in STEM fields revolves, essentially, around differing views of who this responsibility belongs to. 
Conclusion
	While there is much to be gained from either of these viewpoints, and each carries an array of well-informed solutions, they may each be simply treating symptoms of a larger problem. To get to the root, something more essential must be implemented, something which can reconcile these competing views in order to establish more lasting and consequential change.
