Introduction
	There are many ideas thrown around in competing education circles on how to best motivate students, especially in the realm of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) of which computer science and ultimately software development are subcategories. There is particular concern regarding those that are underrepresented within STEM education: women and minorities. One side argues that the missing demographics may simply be due to a lack of personal interest by the underrepresented and, therefore, motivation need only focus on making appeals to draw these students into STEM fields. The other side blames shortcomings in the system of education that leave the underrepresented unprepared and unwilling to enter a STEM field, arguing that in order to motivate these students significant changes must be made in the environment of education. Further consideration of this debate reveals two competing ideologies regarding where the responsibility of a demographic shift really lies.

	Side X: Anti-Initiative
		Intro
			Many educators and academics believe this problem of underrepresentation may simply be due to a lack of interest in STEM fields from women and minority groups. While at first this may seem too simple, there is a good amount of data that supports this conclusion. Researchers have looked into this suspicion with surprising results and have, therefore, concluded that the work of balancing demographics within STEM fields should primarily be focused on creating an atmosphere which draws in more women and people from minority groups. More potently, the idea is that it is individuals' personal choice not to enter a STEM field citing women's performance elsewhere in education, cultural issues, and the potential problems created by affirmative action.

			A. More career options
				One such concept looks beyond STEM education, and finds a simple explanation for the gender gap: perhaps women just have more options. A recent study by [], reveals this in an interesting way. Operating on the assumption that greater math skills make a person more likely to enter a STEM field, researchers compiled a group of nearly 1,500 12th grade students and, using SAT scores, evaluated their mathematical and werbal abilities. Years later when the students were turning 33 years old and had had time to settle into a career, the researchers surveyed them again to see what sort of fields the students had entered. As expected, students with a higher proficiency in mathematics were more likely to have chosen a STEM career—but only the students that scored well in mathematics alone, with their languages skills being lesser. Students that had been indentified as highly proficient in math and language, however, were less likely to enter a STEM field. The important discovery was this: women were more likely to fall into this category being highly proficient in both mathematics and language, and indeed held the majority with females comprising 63 percent of the group. This, Wang et all believes, "may result in females having a wider choice of careers, in both science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and non-STEM fields, compared with males" [CITE]. In other words, the gender gap does not exist because women are less capable, but perhaps for the very opposite reason. The study reveals that women actually tend to have a greater variety of employable skill and may therefore choose to put those skills to work wherever they please; which, happends to be outside the realm of STEM.
			B. Why don't they like STEM?
				Now I hope you will see the apparent flaw in this idea: perhaps the group of students identified as being highly proficient in both math and language did not enter a STEM field because the majority of them were women, and perhaps there is something else that is keeping women from STEM careers. In other words, if women are less likely to enter STEM, and women are more likely to be proficient in math and language then of course a group of people selected for being proficient in math and language will be less likely to enter STEM: that group will mostly be women, and women are less likely to enter STEM. The flaw in this idea is that it is circular and would, therefore, be irrational to attempt to mark any particular place as either cause or effect—it is a classic chicken-and-egg situation. Wang et all, however, anticipated this problem. The 12th graders were evaluated not only on their performance, but were also given a survey of their interest in STEM related material. This is how the researchers came to the conclusion that women were simply choosing other fields: they lacked interest. [STAT][CITE]. This reveals that the problem is, perhaps, not a systemic one. It may not be a problem at all, it may simply be a matter of generalized gender preference and personal choice blown up to the national scale. Washington Post writer Joann Weiner paraphrases Meghan Groome, the executive director of education and public programs at the New York Academy of Sciences, who argues that "almost all of the factors that drive women out of the STEM jobs are cultural" [CITE]. Groome's point is that it is not a question of ability, but things like sterotypical gender indenties that keep women from STEM. Eileen Pollack, who, in 1978, was one of the first women to recieve a bachelor of science degree in physics from Yale, illustrates how these cultural sterotypes are promoted in her New York Times article, "Why Are There Still So Few Women in Science?" She cites the popular television show, "The Big Bang Theory", which stars a number of ultra-nerdy scientists and their cool, blonde, beautiful, "math-and-science-illiterate" neighbor, who waits tables and dreams of becoming an actress. The problem, Pollack explains, is that although these differences are caricaturized and made to be light-hearted, they do point to a very big problem: it's not very cool to be a scientist, or mathematician, or a software developer for that matter. This clash of personal identity leads to an exageratted lack of interest, even to the point of denial [CITE]. Couple this with what Maria Klawe, now the president of Harvey Mudd College, which boasts one of the nation's leading computer science programs, calls 'impostoritis' and it begins compound the problem. Impostoritis, she explains, is being "convinced that everyone could tell that I didn’t belong," despite enormous qualification and success [CITE]. What Klawe means is that even when you are doing just as well as your peers, if they all look uniformely different from you it is incredibly difficult to see through those cultural divides created by gender or race or ethnicity. This leads to the strong sense of disconnect within STEM, which all too often results in an actual disconnect from the field—even before it's given a shot.
			C. What Solutions are there? How do we get individual motivation?			
				Where this side of the debate really defines itself, however, is its dissapproval of the STEM pipeline: a collection of initiatives meant to incentivize and streamline the graduation process for women and underrepresentened minorities into further STEM education and careers. They argue that formal initiatives, such as the pipeline, end up being counterproductive in that they reinforce these cultural ideas on a personal level. In essence, it is a form of affirmative action, though it aims to steer clear of certain connotations that term may carry. However, it often fails to avoid many of the same negative consequences. Elizabeth Patitsas, a PhD candidate in computer science education at the University of Toronto explores this in her peer reviewed article, "Evaluating Diversity Initiatives in Computer Science: Do They Have Unintended Side-Effects?". Patitsas cites research that suggests affirmative action can stand as a constant reminder of the student's minority status, which in turn envokes "stereotype threat" [CITE]. Stereotype threat is the previously discussed idea that simply being reminded of potential stereotypes generally causes decreased performance, especially for underrepresented groups [CITE-stereotype study]. Patitsas also discusses the tendency of these initiatives to create gender- or minority-specific honors, awards, grants and so on. The problem with this is that "women in STEM are more likely to have lower self-esteem for only being good enough for the 'women’s grant [or award or honor]'" [CITE]. In other words, to them their acheivement is diminished because the competition was only amongst the minority of the field. Not only is their own view diminished, but that of their peers, as she explains "studies of female programmers have found that women associated with affirmative action are viewed as less competent than women not associated with affirmative action." This means the initiatives disrupt the individual recipient's view of themself, as well as the view from everyone around them. Success quickly becomes difficult in the face of such adversity and doubt, and perhaps these initiatives deserve part of the blame.

	Synthesis: X argues personal, Y argues communal responsibility
		The debate over how to motivate underrepresented students in STEM fields revolves, essentially, around differing views of who this responsibility belongs to. 
Conclusion
	While there is much to be gained from either of these viewpoints, and each carries an array of well-informed solutions, they may each be simply treating symptoms of a larger problem. To get to the root, something more essential must be implemented, something which can reconcile these competing views in order to establish more lasting and consequential change.
