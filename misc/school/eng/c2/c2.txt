Introduction
	There are many ideas thrown around in competing education circles on how to best motivate students, especially in the realm of or science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). There is a particular concern aimed at finding a way to motivate those that are underrepresented within STEM education: women and minorities. One side argues that the missing demographics may simply be due to a lack of personal interest by the underrepresented and, therefore, motivation need only focus on making appeals to draw these students into STEM fields. The other side blames shortcomings in the system of education that leave the underrepresented unprepared and unwilling to enter a STEM field, arguing that in order to motivate these students significant changes must be made in the environment of education. Further consideration of this debate reveals two competing ideologies regarding where the responsibility of a demographic shift really lies.
Body
	Side X: Lack of Interest
		Intro
			Many educators and academics believe this problem of underrepresentation may simply be due to a lack of interest in STEM fields from women and minority groups. While at first this may seem too simple, there is a good amount of data that supports this conclusion. Researchers have looked into this suspicion with surprising results and  therefore, determined that the work of balancing demographics within STEM fields should primarily be focused on creating an atmosphere which draws in more women and people from minority groups. More potently, the idea is that it is individuals' personal choice not to enter a STEM field. This view dismisses the proposed problem of systematic educational shortcomings, citing women's performance elsewhere in education, b, and c.

	Synthesis: X argues personal, Y argues communal responsibility
		The debate over how to motivate underrepresented students in STEM fields revolves, essentially, around differing views of who this responsibility belongs to. 
Conclusion
	While there is much to be gained from either of these viewpoints, and each carries an array of well-informed solutions, they may each be simply treating symptoms of a larger problem. To get to the root, something more essential must be implemented, something which can reconcile these competing views in order to establish more lasting and consequential change.
