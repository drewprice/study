				Fixed-mindsets that regard ability and skill as inherent and unchangeable hinder the progression and development of computer programmers by creating false barriers, limiting experimentation, and enabling stereotyping.

						<div class="text">
							<h4>Summary</h4>
								<p>Lednicer suggests that while college is likely necessary for a career in tech, the classic approach to computer science studies is no longer effective in producing highly employable graduates. Lednicer explores this idea by presenting statistics and information that demonstrate the growing industry. She explains that employers are looking for well-rounded, critical thinkers with team-based production experience. Lednicer then walks through several different ways universities are attempting to meet this demand. Her purpose is to inform future college students and their parents of what the job market requires, and challenge them to adopt that framework when deciding on a program.</p>

						<div class="text">
							<h4>Annotation</h4>
								<p>This article is very current, though it is generally more of a popular piece than it is academic. It does not seem unreliable, though it could be much stronger if the quoted statistics were documented more clearly. Without a detailed explanation, Lednicer states that college is necessary for tech career hopefuls. Her anecdotal research is largely made up of big name, highly selective colleges, thus creating a bias to that end.</p>

						<h4>Summary</h4>
							<p>In this report, Clifford Adelman examines the records of two cohorts of computer science students: the first between 1972 and 1984, and the second between 1982 and 1993. He argues that formal secondary education is only able to keep up with the developing field, but is incapable of leading it. He does this by meticulously analyzing student records, associate'source and bachelor'source degree curricula, graduate studies subfields, and the labor market. He demonstrates that the formal discipline is maturing and becoming more refined, but that the labor market is still changing rapidly.</p>

						<h4>Annotation</h4>
							<p>Despite its age, the report'source 20 year period of coverage helps to maintain its relevance. This broad look offers a good deal of foresight, and furthermore, allows more general ideas to come through. Certainly the field of computer science and its study has changed dramatically since 1997, but many of the principles rooted in this report still seem sound. Adelman is excruciatingly thorough in his research, and thoughtfully interprets results in a helpful way.</p>

					<h4>Summary</h4>
						<p>Dr. Carol Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford University, explores some of the implications of her research on intellectual mindsets and their effect on student learning. She argues that a &quot;growth mindset&quot;, one that welcomes learning as a challenge, enables students to become life-long learners capable of far greater understanding than if they succomb to the &quot;fixed mindset&quot;, that their intellectual skills and abilities are predetermined and static. For this reason, teachers must introduce and encourage the growth mindset. Her purpose is to distinguish the two different mindsets and reveal the benefits of a growth mindset while offering practical solutions for its implementation.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="text">
					<h4>Annotation</h4>
						<p>Dweck is the clear leader in this field of thought, with many academic publications. She is well esteemed by her colleagues. The article itself does not present her research in detail, only alluding to it contextually and citing her relevant publications in a reference section. However, it does provide a concise explanation of her mindset theories, as well as an clear illustration of their use in the learning environment.</p>

				<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>In this article, the authors argue that self-theories are particularly relevant in the study of computer science and because of this, these studies must be infused with growth mindset attributes from the start. The authors begin by introducing the concepts and research developed by psychologists regarding self-theories. They then explore several areas within computer science education that illustrate the negative effects of fixed mindsets, both in students and educators. Following this, they offer guidance for the proper implementation of growth mindset education within the computer science curriculum.</p>
